          <h1>Medium attrition created</h1>
          <p>Dorian received a raise on Jun/22 QSR but since he moved to Brazil and his expenses were growing fast he shared with PxP that the raise was not enough</p>

          <h3 class="date">End of September/22</h3>
          <h1>Several 1-1 meetings and checkpoints</h1>
          <p>
            Durting the 1-1s with PM and CP with PxP he always shared that he could see that his salary was below the average of the market, as a way to reduce the heat he was assigned as a mentor and iformed that he would be added to next QSR
          </p>
          <p>
            Dorian was added to September's QSR, when creating the BC it was informed that his FP shared that we should keep him happy and also that there was an ongoing attrition but, as expected, it was denied.

          <h1>SE informed about QSR</h1>
          <p>
            During the first 1-1 after the QSR result PM informed the SE about the negative.
          </p>
          <p>
              SE's reaction was ok, not happy but he understood since he ha recently received a raise. Again he mentioned about the average income for other SEs. We agreed on a new try in 3 months (next QSR). Jira ticket updated mentioning that no further action was necessary.

          <h1>PxP had a checkpoint and everything was fine</h1>
          <p>
            "He wasn’t pleased with the denial of the increase, of course, but he’s more than willing to wait until January 2023 to try again. Other than that, he was happy because he’s been receiving good feedback from Pinterest."
          </p>
          <p>
            We agreed to keep the attrition opened as a medium.

          <h1>Once more, QSR denied</h1>
          <p>      Again the salary review was denied for Dorian, BC was explaining the attrition (still medium), feedback from Pinterest and he was marked as a rockstar.
          </p>
        </div>

      <li>

          <h1>SE informed about QSR</h1>
          <p>
            He reacted "well", again mentioned about other companies that he could see recruiting on Linkedin but never mentioned any other offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the CP with PxP we agreed that Dorian was not expressive and told that " he has a very clear expectation of salary, which we wouldn’t have covered even if this increase had been approved".
          </p>
          <p>PxP suggested on the ticket to raise the attrition to a HIGH</p>
        </div>

          <h3 class="date">Jan 16th/23</h3>
          <h1>PM meets SE</h1>
          <p>
            During a call with Dorian he mentioned that he was sad about not receiving the increase, he told that he was not actually looking for another job and shared that he enjoys working with Baires and Pinterest. We agreed again in giving the QSR another shot, he was still mentoring another SE to increase his income and also he was an ambassador.
          </p>
          <p>
              After the conversation with Dorian it felt like there was no need to increase the ticket to a High attrition. THE TICKET WAS NOT UPDATED MENTIONING THIS NEW MEETING OR THAT WE WOULD NOT CHANGE THE SEVERITY OF THE ATTRITION.

          <h1>Urgent attrition created</h1>
          <p>
            SE reaches out saying that he plans to stay with us until middle of March, and he would update his Linkedin at the end of February. No offer in hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Urgent attrition created as "employee trying to quit"

          <h1>SWAT involved</h1>
          <p>
            SWAT shared that the situation should've been handled in a different way, since it was recommended to raise the attrition severity before and it was "ignored".
          </p>
      </li>

            After 3 different offers he finally accepted to stay with us.
